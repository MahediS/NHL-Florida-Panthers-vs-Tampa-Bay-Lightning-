2025 Playoff Series: What Is at Stake
Team Profiles
Tampa Bay Lightning
2nd, Atlantic Division, 102 points.
Revamped roster after busy offseason minus some major players: Steven Stamkos left, Jake Guentzel and J.J. Moser came, and the facts of science got younger and faster.
Franchise fixtures Andrei Vasilevskiy (G), Victor Hedman (D), Nikita Kucherov (F), and Brandon Hagel (F) are still the backbone.
Headed into the playoffs, balanced and experienced, and full of revenge after last year’s early exit.
Florida Panthers
3rd in Atlantic Division, 98 points.
They are the defending Stanley Cup champions, but their points percentage fell from last season.
Managed injuries to Matthew Tkachuk and suspensions to Aaron Ekblad, but bread-and-butter stars Sam Reinhart, Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky are healthy and awaiting the playoffs.
Famous for ferocious penalty killing and dangerous shorthanded scoring.
